"""[summary]
This library is a tiny fully functional deep learning library made using numpy. And pycuda for GPU support. It has a sizable list of features and more are being added. Any contributions are welcome as I am just one person working on this project.
Since this is mostly a learning project, the aim is to not replace or be "better" than anyone else. Just to make a proper repository with almost all the required parts functioning and easy enough to understand unlike the major libraries. Although I doubt anyone will ever use this, but I hope one day it might help someone out :)

This documentation will outline everything that is available. You are encouraged to look at the source code though. Click the [source] option and it should point out the function for you. 

Enjoy! Happy learning and hope you make amazing projects.
