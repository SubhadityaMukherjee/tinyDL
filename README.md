# TinyDL(WIP)

- Tiny Deep learning library
- Super WIP
- New features will be added as time goes

## Why?
- Pytorch is too complicated to learn from
- This does not intend to replace it. Just to understand what goes into it
- An attempt at recreating most of the essential components from scratch
- Eventual blogs on it as well

## Whats there so far
- Dataloader
        - Basic dataloader
        - Supports multiprocessing
        - Accepts int, float, numpy arrays
        - Note : No tensors yet


## How to run
- python runner.py

## Requirements
- numpy
